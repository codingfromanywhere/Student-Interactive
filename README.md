# Student-Interactive To-Do List with Task Grouping feature
This project aims to build a web-based application that allows users to create and manage to-do lists with grouping features based on categories or projects. Users can create new tasks, set priorities, group tasks into categories (for example: “College”, “Personal”, “Work”), as well as mark tasks as completed. This app is suitable for helping users better organize their time and priorities. This application uses JavaScript to manage its interactive logic, such as adding new tasks, updating task status, and saving and loading data from Local Storage for data persistence.

## Key Features:
 * **Add New Task:** Users can add new tasks by providing a task description, assigning a category, and specifying a priority (high, medium, or low).
 * **Grouping by Category:** The added tasks will be grouped by user-selected categories, such as “College”, “Personal”, or “Work”. Users can view and manage tasks based on these categories.
 * **Task Priority:** Each task has a priority marked with a specific color or symbol, so users can easily identify which one is the most urgent.
 * **Marking Tasks As Completed:** Users can mark a task as complete, and it will be moved to the “Completed Tasks” section, or removed from the list.
 * **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks that are no longer relevant. Once deleted, the task will disappear from the list.
 * **Data Storage with Local Storage:** All task data is stored using Local Storage, so when users reload the page, their data remains and can be accessed again.

An interactive task management application that is simple yet comprehensive enough to help users manage their daily tasks. With grouping features by category and priority, as well as data persistence using Local Storage, users can utilize it to manage their time and tasks more effectively. This app can be further developed by adding search features, task filters, or backend integration.
